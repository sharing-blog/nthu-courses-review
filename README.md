# Course Review Automation Tool
> [中文版](README_ZHTW.md)

- A simple tool to automate the organizing of university course reviews.  
- The workflow is lightweight, ad-free, and community-driven.
- Designed to keep information clean, accessible, and free from unnecessary noise.

## Workflow

1. **User submits Google Form** → responses stored in **Google Sheets**.  
2. **Google Apps Script** extracts data and places the course review in the correct position in the Markdown file.  
3. The Markdown is shared on **HackMD** for easy reading and contribution.

## Why This Project Exists
- Many platforms require accounts, show ads, or are cluttered with biased/hateful comments.
- I found it tiring to browse multiple platforms like OPT 歐趴糖, DCard, and ptt for course info.
- A **simple Markdown** with:
  - Lecturer overview
  - Student reviews
  - Grading weight breakdown  
  will make course selection much easier.
- Contributions are open, allowing everyone to benefit from shared feedback — all in one place: **HackMD**.
