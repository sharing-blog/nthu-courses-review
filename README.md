## Why This Project Exists
- Many platforms require accounts, show ads, or are cluttered with biased/hateful comments.
- I found it tiring to browse multiple platforms like OPT Ê≠êË∂¥Á≥ñ, DCard, and ptt for course info.
- A **simple Markdown** with:
  - Lecturer overview
  - Student reviews
  - Grading weight breakdown  
  will make course selection much easier.
- Contributions are open, allowing everyone to benefit from shared feedback ‚Äî all in one place: **HackMD**.
